    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;This is the one time a year where I force myself to write more than 140 characters in a single sitting about stuff I did in the past 12 months.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;2015 to-do list recap&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Firstly, how well did I meet some of my aims I set at the end of last year? Sadly I didn't make huge progress with my to-do list, for reasons explained in more detail below. However, 2016 is full of potential so all is definitely not lost. To recap, here's what I had aimed to do in 2015:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;div class="todo"&gt;
&lt;h5&gt;More mentoring&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did take on a larger mentoring role at R/GA, and we felt we were making progress. But due to geography much of it was done over video-conferencing, which is always a less than ideal communication medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;More Code Club and educational things for young people&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately I had to stop running the Leytonstone Code Club due to time constraints. I will find a replacement Clubber for them this year. In the meantime I have a large education-focused project to work on as part of my new job, so I haven't abandoned the computer science education area completely.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;More side projects with my friends&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Ugh. I managed to spend a pathetically small amount of time on &lt;a href="http://www.badonnathon.com"&gt;Badonnathon 2.0&lt;/a&gt;, now called Good Tunes and relaunched for Ben's New York marathon. In the end the heroic &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ihuntington"&gt;Ian Huntington&lt;/a&gt; did 99.999% of the work, and Ben raised a staggering amount of $$$$$. I would still love to package Badonnathon/Good Tunes as an easy to customize, simple set up fundraising campaign for all charity runners. Maybe this year we can all pull our fingers out and make this happen?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h5&gt;London Tilde Club&lt;/h5&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Nope :(&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So anyway here's what I actually ended up doing in 2015:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;R/GA&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At the start of 2015 I did a few months of research, planning, architecture and hiring for an iOS app and website for an international fast-food franchise, aimed at producing a casual gaming platform for 7-12 year olds. We worked with another agency called Preloaded for the build of the app itself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It's called Happy Studio and it finally came out in December, and it's really great. It contains zero fast food references. Actually don't think it contains any mention of the international fast-food franchise at all. But it's truly entertaining, full of personality, and encourages and rewards exploratory play rather than competitiveness or acquisition. Enormous amounts of childrens education research went into the app, and I'm incredibly proud of the team who delivered it. My kids love it, and we often spend time playing it together. &lt;a href="http://www.happystudio.com"&gt;Download it here&lt;/a&gt; and give it a go.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://www.happystudio.com"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="394" alt="This is a screenshot of the McDonald's Happy Studio app" src="/images/mcd.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I also did some work rethinking the meaning of masculinity for a fast-selling consumer goods company in order to sell more deodorant. If you ever want to get a true sense of what working in an advertising agency is like, try spending three months endlessly presenting decks titled "Masculine Identity In Tribal Subcultures" before ultimately imploding under the weight of your own lofty ideas and delivering yet another stop-gap Tumblr site with a comically tone-deaf tagline.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Stemettes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I helped run R/GA's second STEM In A Day event, this time welcoming young women from &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/LambethAcademy"&gt;Lambeth Academy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/ShenfieldHigh"&gt;Shenfield High School&lt;/a&gt; in Essex to learn about combining creativity and code. It was another very rewarding session, with everyone enthusiastically brainstorming creative technology approaches to a brief, before putting together wireframes, user flows and app prototypes to demo to the whole group.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="https://stemettes.wordpress.com"&gt;&lt;img width="640" height="480" alt="This screengrab of me and some R/GA-ers from a video of us talking about Stemettes and R/GA." src="/images/stem.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This age group understand technology as now being so pervasive that even niche as-yet-unreleased hardware like Oculus Rift is seen by them as an entirely natural, sensible and feasible solution. Stemettes are a great organisation, and I hope we were able to encourage some of the students to consider studying one or more STEM subjects at school and beyond.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;antipattern&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This year &lt;a href="http://www.s-u-k-i.com"&gt;Suki&lt;/a&gt; and I officially formed a design studio and gave it a name: &lt;a href="http://antipattern.co"&gt;antipattern&lt;/a&gt;. Finding a work/life/antipattern balance continues to present a challenge, but it's one we're keen to take on. In 2015 we worked on projects for Ninja Tune, the Association of Independent Music, and an online music startup called Juice VCR. More details of each project are below:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://antipattern.co"&gt;&lt;img width="700" height="395" alt="This is a screenshot of the antipattern website" src="/images/anti.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Solid Steel&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In April we launched our biggest project to date — a brand new platform for Solid Steel, the longest running mix show in the world, produced in association with Ninja Tune.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="#"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/solid.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Solid Steel wanted to relaunch their website to celebrate running for 25 years. They also needed to add support for mobile devices, search and filtering functionality and tight integration with Soundcloud.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is perfectly minimal, totally balanced in form and functionality. Tech details: front-end is Ember, backend is Rails, MySQL on Ubuntu on Digital Ocean. I really enjoyed working with Ember. The development environment and workflow they have produced is extremely productive (once you're past a fairly steep initial learning curve), with local server, optimisation, tests and scaffolding functions all built in.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Indie Label Cup&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We produced an &lt;a href="http://indielabelcup.co.uk"&gt;interactive website&lt;/a&gt; for a charity football tournament involving the music labels Ninja Tune, 4AD, Bella Union, Heavenly and more, raising money for Crisis. It features real kickable footballs and realistic crowd sounds!&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://indielabelcup.co.uk"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/footy.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Juice VCR&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Jessica was impressed with our Solid Steel work, and asked if we'd like to be involved in the launch of her &lt;a href="http://juicevcr.com"&gt;new music broadcasting platform, Juice VCR&lt;/a&gt;. The focus is 100% on curated music videos and independent artists, and the site delivers on this vision with an interface that gets out of your way ASAP. Tech details: the front-end is Backbone, with &lt;a href="https://github.com/videojs"&gt;Video.js&lt;/a&gt; handling the music player and wrappers for YouTube and Vimeo APIs. Backend is Craft CMS, a really nice, easily customisable PHP CMS with a pretty friendly authoring UI.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://juicevcr.com"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/juice.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Google&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In May while we were on half-term holiday in Derbyshire I got an email from Google. They asked if I was interested in talking to them about a job. I assumed it was spam at first. But about a week later I wrote back and said yes, of course I'd be interested. A phone call swiftly followed, then a face-to-face with my hiring manager, Dave, in Google's quirky, thickly carpeted Covent Garden office. He explained what he was looking for. Then he said he wanted me to go to Mountain View to talk to some more people. OK!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/SB9of29fN24cjTIhoYsQbWwcmwjYLcSQYVrDu5qoNqIDeZjxlhQ0qj7cmdb3W6pSvp21gGanDQWzBrh3HlMS8qCD-X7p6XXJTgGCzSfNbnWd-xrA-BjyphboovWmrbG_BSoItYmH2r4xPjoocVxHCilrSptxS1TFDyqlXkSP8hqjnH9cwLDjKhQe3rlyMxCj4d1RS8b9zHJUqhRzSebWn-_QHl5GFBzmbDTKaBv3QQYWgzFidTRQ431l3fh4xPMTLRDBu0VWEC5kD4Ea4TCFD9rA1IlvhilNFgjR4XdIgkBKhs-S7-hi6ufxnVfNgXbzkqORbRN5TaWSfQm4L--LeuOXQdT2tcZjGJJrN8sNTImNaoqzyPkmIEC2zQ7NHVPY6dZKYSw3qCDDBWUDui8PyXOHxa3ASoVFiJoa4scy3MM-YzQzZJYDYc-rIe9mSzcf1RB1bPaxKOsm_I_8FxwXkjyhhH3g28YwjAuhfa1m9oLwlde3MTRn4Olr4kiSXk4jM2IyR0DGNzB2w-nuZx31OQuZA5QAoZUOToycrx49K5ZgRddnQlSiLUyDjtA7QxXcsjC2=w1280-h960-no" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Google's travel agency sorted out flights, hotel and hire car for the 5-day visit. Kate kept asking me if there was atually a job on offer at the end of all this. Good question! I wasn't sure. I had two days before the interviews which I spent swotting up on things I wanted to talk about, looking around Palo Alto, Stanford and Cupertino, doing trial runs to the main Google campus in my hire car, and squeezing in a couple of visits to In-N-Out Burger. I wandered longingly around Bev Mo, an enormous craft beer shop the size of a standard Waitrose, for about an hour. I put together a massive bag of crazy American sweets to take home for the kids.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had all four interviews scheduled on one day. The HR person emailed twice to say the location had been moved. The campus is huge, strecthing over dozens of blocks in Mountain View, so each time I would have to check the map to make sure it wasn't so far away that I'd be late. In the end I was pretty early, but still struggled to find a parking place. Everyone drives to work I guess. I walked onto the campus, noted the volleyball court, the giant dinosaur statue, a tour group which contained two uniformed military officers, and the rows of multi-coloured bikes which Googlers use to get around the offices. At this point I did a LOL and said myself "What the hell am I doing here?!".&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/IMG_1436.JPG" /&gt;
&lt;span&gt;—This is me on a Google bike—&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was met by a recruiter at the office, and we chatted for a bit while we waited for my interviewers to turn up. I met the Global Tech Lead for the team I was being interviewed for, plus its Managing Director, Director and a software engineer. Everyone was completely charming, and took so many notes I often had to pause speaking to allow them to catch up. I had a technical interview where I had to hand write code with a pencil and paper. We talked about a broad range of subjects, from security to creativity to managing engineers. Halfway through I got to take a break and have an "off the record" lunch with a Googler related to the team I might be joining. We joined a queue at a salad bar, where chefs tossed together any combination of three-dozen ingredients for you. The food was all free, and amazing. We ate outside in the sun and my co-luncher talked about the importance of self-direction and motivation at Google.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These were the most interesting, relaxed and enjoyable interviews I've ever had. Everyone was fully briefed on me and my background, there were plenty of opportunities for questions, and the conversation was relaxed and interesting, wandering far and wide like it might if you were meeting someone at a bar for the first time. I said goodbye, took one more walk around the Googleplex to take it all in, then headed for San Francisco airport.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Flying straight home immediately after the interviews was a big mistake! I spent 11 hours in the air fretting about whether I'd said the right things, about whether they liked me or not, whether I'd been too casual, or not casual enough. I was stuck a mile up in the air without any internet or anyone to talk to about it. The next day I landed and went straight to Weymouth to catch up with my family, who were on holiday again.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I heard back from the London office a few days later. Everything seemed to go ok. They kept me quite up-to-date over the next few weeks, as my "packet" made its way through the recruitment system. This process is documented very well in &lt;a href="https://www.workrules.net/uk"&gt;Laszlo Bock's book Work Rules!&lt;/a&gt;. Laszlo is SVP of People Operations at Google. There is also an excellent series of questions and answers about Google's hiring practices by &lt;a href="https://www.quora.com/profile/Bob-See"&gt;an ex-Google engineering recruiter on Quora&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Very basically, when interviewing at Google you will normally have one phone interview, one face-to-face interview with a hiring manager, and four or five face-to-face interviews with people closely related to your job. Then all the notes and scores from all your interviewers go into a "packet" which goes to a hiring committee for approval (or not). Then it goes to a remuneration committee, where some clever maths is done to make sure you're offered the right amount of salary and benefits. Then everything goes to an SVP to get rubber stamped. My packet got delayed twice because the recruiting committee meetings got moved. Eventually....my recruiter called me, confirmed there was an offer, and talked me through all the details on the phone. It felt so good to finally hear it! I went to the pub for an extended lunch.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;My hiring manager kept in touch during my notice period, including inviting me to an offsite with the whole team about two weeks before I would officially start working with them. I didn't want to miss the chance to meet the team, so I junped at the chance. We had a fantastic two days in a rambling Oxfordshire mansion, with amazing food and wine, great company, lots of fun and some pretty intensive prototyping sessions run by Marina and Zak, two Googlers from Mountain View.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A few weeks later I started work, and it's been crazy ever since. I just got back from my third visit to Mountain View, and next week I'm meeting the Deep Mind team to talk about potential uses for their machine learning capability. I'm on the Expeditions team which takes Cardboard into schools to demonstrate VR technology to students and teachers. We've designed and launched two amazing websites since November: a &lt;a href="https://www.google.com/maps/about/behind-the-scenes/streetview/treks/petra/"&gt;Petra Streetview&lt;/a&gt; and an immersive &lt;a href="https://performingarts.withgoogle.com/en_us"&gt;Performing Arts 360-video experience&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;hr /&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven't quite had time to catch my breath and think about aims and ambitions for this year. But when I do I'll update this page. In the meantime here is a picture of Jacob at a restaurant in June 2015:&lt;/p&gt;

      <name>Article Author</name>
    </author>
    <content type="html">&lt;p&gt;I was inspired by reading &lt;a href="http://www.iamdanw.com/wrote/yearnote-2014/"&gt;Dan W's&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://alicebartlett.co.uk/blog/yearnotes-2014"&gt;Alice Bartlett's&lt;/a&gt; year-summarizing posts, so I wrote this one. I don't really know either &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/iamdanw"&gt;Dan W&lt;/a&gt; or &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/alicebartlett"&gt;Alice Bartlett&lt;/a&gt; but we all appear to work in similar internet-y areas of technology and their Twitters are always interesting, containing as they do tales of container ship trips and tampon clubs etc.

&lt;p&gt;I don't think I had an especially eventful 2014, so this definitely isn't intended to be trumpet-blowing. But it's nice to be able to look back on the times when I managed to put some effort into non-worky things. Things I'd definitely like to do more of this year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Heineken&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Let's start with work-work. Most of my year at R/GA was spent launching &lt;a href="http://openyourcity.heineken.com/"&gt;Open Your City&lt;/a&gt;, a global advertising campaign for Heineken. The work included a mobile-optimised website and intelligent Twitter-bot which supplied realtime going-out recommendations based on your location (plus the small matter of one billion promotional codes on specially-printed bottle labels...).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;It's a really nice service, with a decent amount of algorithmic magic going on in the background to make sure the tips are really very useful. Heineken themselves got a lot of mileage out of it, being named The Drum's most-creative brand of 2014. And while launching it I got to have some fun attending the press junkets: sat next to jacuzzis talking to journalists on a Soho hotel rooftop. We got some good coverage from the trade press and it was part of our winning submission for &lt;a href="http://www.campaignlive.co.uk/news/1326025/"&gt;Campaign Magazine's Digital Innovation Agency of the Year&lt;/a&gt; award.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;a href="http://openyourcity.heineken.com/"&gt;&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="/images/taxi.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Other work&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I spent about two months planning a huge physical computing campaign for an enormo-client, which ended up being postponed, cancelled, reinstated, reimagined and reworked entirely. It may by now have actually transmogrified into an authentic brand engagment film experience being shot in an exotic location nowhere near a computer of any kind. I work in an advertising agency. These things happen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The remainder of the work year has been spent in discovery mode for another super-project, the first evidence of which you should start to see in October this year. Big ideas require big calendars. See you in October!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Stemettes&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I was lucky enough to work with Anne-Marie Imafidon and Yasmin Lodhi of &lt;a href="http://www.stemettes.org/"&gt;Stemettes&lt;/a&gt;, a project aimed at inspiring the next generation of women into Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics jobs and learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/105637677@N06/15682349149" title="R/GA STEM in a Day - October 2014 by Stemettes HQ, on Flickr"&gt;&lt;img src="https://farm9.staticflickr.com/8626/15682349149_dfb3b10f23_c.jpg" alt="R/GA STEM in a Day - October 2014" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with Stemettes we ran a full day introducing 20 students to the opportunities STEM subjects can offer in the world of work. We had a amazing group of girls in years 9 and 10 (age 13 and 14) from two schools in Essex. With great help from a number of my colleagues, we took the girls through what we do at R/GA and explained how technology fits into our creative work. Then we showed them some simple tools for prototyping, as well as the basics of building web pages. Then we challenged them with a real brief and gave them the afternoon to brainstorm, validate their ideas, put together a pitch and create an app or website to show their concept.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was absolutely amazed by the quality of the girls' ideas, their enthusiastic interpretation of the brief, and the speed at which they worked. We talk a lot about millenials and digital natives, but to have them standing in front of you confidently pushing ideas that wouldn't look out of place on one of our meeting room walls, that's am extremely enlightening experience. I also had Youtubers girlsplained to me, so now I know.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a real privilege to be work with Stemettes and all the girls, and I hope they found it as rewarding as I did. Anne-Marie describes herself as “a woman on a mission”, which is entirely accurate, and you can't really fail to be inspired by her as she steps off a plane direct from the &lt;a href="http://gracehopper.org/"&gt;Grace Hopper Celebration of Women in Computing&lt;/a&gt; conference in Phoenix, Arizona and walks straight into the day-long event we'd organised for young girls we'd organised, brandishing Google Cardboard kits and banging on about how Satya Nadella was stitched up over his comments about women and promotions. We're planning on doing more STEM days this year, and also some more focused and longer-term mentoring, which I'm really looking forward to.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Code Club&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I started a &lt;a href="https://www.codeclub.org.uk/"&gt;Code Club&lt;/a&gt; at George Tomlinson School in Leytonstone. The idea is to teach computational thinking to year 5 and 6 students (9 and 10 year-olds). In practice it means we use approachable programming tools to create things the students are interested in — games, apps, animations and movies. It is incredibly rewarding, and I highly recommend you think about running a club if you have even basic programming skills. At our club the students use &lt;a href="http://scratch.mit.edu/"&gt;Scratch&lt;/a&gt;, which is an open-source drag-and-drop web interface for creating programs. The underlying language is based on Smalltalk. Students can progress at their own pace, and can even carry on at home or elsewhere. And programs can be shared and remixed by anyone else, reminiscent of the “view-source” culture of the web. How far the students go in each session, and how much they learn, is totally up to them — you are there to facilitate their learning.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every session also has a teacher present. This is very reassuring, as the practicality of managing 15 students bouncing off the walls with energy and questions is not something I had really considered before I signed up. One thing I realised immediately was how bloody tiring teaching is, and I was only doing it for a few hours a week, with only half a class! The other thing I realised — and thinking back to my own school days the irony involved apalls me even now — is the importance of preparation! I usually stayed up extra late the night before a club, trying to anticipate the many curveballs and requests the students were guaranteed to throw my way the next day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Convergence&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I got to work with the lovely people at Village Underground in Shoreditch, who are organising another edition of the fantastic &lt;a href="http://convergence-london.com"&gt;Convergence&lt;/a&gt; festival this year. They wanted a website which reflected the aims and culture of the festival, which is focused on the experimental and collaborative nature of music, art and technology.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The resulting work was a collaboration with my regular design partner-in-crime &lt;a href="http://www.s-u-k-i.com"&gt;Suki&lt;/a&gt;, which we had to turn around in about a week! I can't wait to see Clark and Vessels blow the roof off VU at the &lt;a href="http://convergence-london.com/events/opening-party-clark-vessels"&gt;opening party in March&lt;/a&gt;. Plus I haven't been able to stop listening to &lt;a href="http://open.spotify.com/album/5M7H7J3LJfIk9zqcDJVi6T"&gt;Kiasmos&lt;/a&gt; for months so I recommend &lt;a href="http://convergence-london.com/events/kiasmos"&gt;checking them out at St John-at-Hackney.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://convergence-london.com"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/convergence.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Shimell and Madden&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I also got to work with the inspirational and absolutely lovely jewellery design duo of Emma and Luke, who create beautiful handmade jewellery as &lt;a href="http://shimellandmadden.com"&gt;Shimell and Madden&lt;/a&gt;. Their workshop in Shoreditch is knee-deep in mathematical diagrams and scientific research, and every piece I've seen people wearing never fails to elicict comments and compliments. Do check out their work, as every piece has lifetimes of thought and craft put into it. Again, the work came about quite by chance after I'd bought one of their necklaces for my wife early in the year. We got to talking about each of our crafts, and a few months later they asked if I could help them out with a new site.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked on the website and ecommerce shop with the talented designer and typographer &lt;a href="http://holmkvist.co.uk"&gt;Robert Holmvist&lt;/a&gt;. Like any good work it was a true collaboration and learning curve for us all.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href="http://shimellandmadden.com"&gt;&lt;img src="/images/sm.jpg" /&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;First Things First&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I did an &lt;a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com/3027510/the-first-things-first-manifesto-pledges-the-tech-industry-to-create-meaningful-work"&gt;interview&lt;/a&gt; with &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/sydbrownstone"&gt;Sydney Brownstone&lt;/a&gt; at &lt;a href="http://www.fastcoexist.com"&gt;Fast Company&lt;/a&gt; about the &lt;a href="http://firstthingsfirst2014.org"&gt;First Things First Manifesto&lt;/a&gt;. This was a refresh of the earlier First Things First manifestos (in &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Things_First_1964_manifesto"&gt;1964&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/First_Things_First_2000_manifesto"&gt;2000&lt;/a&gt;), each of which had the same aim of rallying a community of creative professionals to put their collective skills to more worthwhile use. I am particularly driven by the acknowledgment of the manifesto that it is the responsibility of members of the creative and technology industries themselves to create positive changes within them. So I'm trying to highlight the need for advertising agencies to improve our record on diversity and inclusion, especially gender imbalance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Also&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In 2014 I started mentoring 2 developers in R/GA's Bucharest office. Mentoring has a different feel from line-management. It allows us to focus purely on ideas around technology and exploration, which I think is a nice opportunity for us both. I also had a lovely family holiday in Italy, where it turns out that my kids love gelato even more than they love ice cream. I went to Serbia for &lt;a href="http://resonate.io/2015/"&gt;Resonate&lt;/a&gt;, and both the country and the conference were revelations — the friendliest places I've been to in a long time. I'll be heading back this year. Also hopefullly &lt;a href="http://eyeofestival.com"&gt;eyeo&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I bought a Kindle and read more books last year than I did in the previous two put together. This is because you can (just about) fit in in your jeans pocket and so can take it anywhere. Also you can read it in the dark. I mucked about with &lt;a href="http://tilde.club/~paulcarvill/"&gt;Tilde Club&lt;/a&gt; a bit, which is fun because it's basically a load of &lt;em&gt;media professionals&lt;/em&gt; coding websites ironically not ironically, and sometimes it's nice just to be part of someone else's silly idea that they know is silly but also take too seriously. Finally, I saw some great gigs: Sun Ra Arkestra at Barbican in June, Darkside at the Coronet in March, A Love Supreme at the Festival Hall as part of James Lavelle's Meltdown, Kelis at Somerset House, Kelela at Corsica Studios, Young Fathers at XOYO, Tony Allen at Village Underground. Also the Duchess of Malfi by candlelight in the all-wooden Sam Wanamaker Playhouse on Southbank.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4&gt;Next...&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Some ideas for things I'd like to continue doing or do more of this year:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;• More mentoring. I saw Cennydd Bowles recently posted about his &lt;a href="https://twitter.com/Cennydd/status/552460224997916672"&gt;availability to mentor junior digital product designers&lt;/a&gt;, and it seems like a really good idea to open up this kind of activity outside of the usual work channels.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;• More Code Club and Code Club-style things. I'd actually like to do one aimed at older people who want to learn the nuts and bolts of web development. I know people like General Assembly and others do run programming courses, but I think the cost is probably prohibitive for many people.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;• More side projects with my friends. I feel like I let work consume me a bit too much last year, and didn't give myself time to have fun and do silly things. Or serious things. I definitely need to do more of both.&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;• I think I'll set up a London Tilde Club if anyone's interested in learning how we used to do things on the web before it all descended into just &lt;a href="http://www.emarketer.com/Article/Digital-Ad-Spending-Worldwide-Hit-3613753-Billion-2014/1010736"&gt;plugging our brains into a giant digital sewage pipe spewing advertising into us&lt;/a&gt; while also being followed by sinister men with &lt;a href="http://www.theguardian.com/world/interactive/2013/nov/01/prism-slides-nsa-document"&gt;ridiculous Powerpoint decks&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
	&lt;li&gt;&lt;p&gt;• Err, that's it so far. Hopefully I'll add to this list as the year goes on :)&lt;/p&gt;&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;/p&gt;
